// 3169. Count Days Without Meetings
// You are given a positive integer days representing the total number of days an employee is available for work (starting from day 1). You are also given a 2D array meetings of size n where, meetings[i] = [start_i, end_i] represents the starting and ending days of meeting i (inclusive).

// Return the count of days when the employee is available for work but no meetings are scheduled.

// Note: The meetings may overlap.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: days = 10, meetings = [[5,7],[1,3],[9,10]]

// Output: 2

// Explanation:

// There is no meeting scheduled on the 4th and 8th days.

// Example 2:

// Input: days = 5, meetings = [[2,4],[1,3]]

// Output: 1

// Explanation:

// There is no meeting scheduled on the 5th day.

// Example 3:

// Input: days = 6, meetings = [[1,6]]

// Output: 0

// Explanation:

// Meetings are scheduled for all working days.

    /**
     * Algorithm:
     * 1. Sort the meetings array based on the start time. (O(N log N))
     * 2. Initialize a variable `prevEnd` to keep track of the last occupied day. (O(1))
     * 3. Iterate through each meeting: (O(N))
     *    a. Determine the actual start day of the meeting by taking the max of meeting start and `prevEnd + 1`.
     *    b. Calculate the length of the meeting as (end - start + 1).
     *    c. Deduct the valid meeting length from the available `days`.
     *    d. Update `prevEnd` to the maximum of its current value and the meetingâ€™s end day.
     * 4. Return the remaining `days` after processing all meetings. (O(1))
     * 
     * Pseudocode:
     * 
     * FUNCTION countDays(days, meetings):
     *     SORT meetings based on start time
     *     prevEnd = 0
     *     FOR each meeting in meetings:
     *         start = MAX(meeting[0], prevEnd + 1)
     *         length = meeting[1] - start + 1
     *         days -= MAX(length, 0)
     *         prevEnd = MAX(prevEnd, meeting[1])
     *     RETURN days
     * 
     * Time Complexity: O(N log N) due to sorting, followed by O(N) iteration, resulting in O(N log N) overall.
     * Space Complexity: O(1) as sorting is done in place and only a few extra variables are used.

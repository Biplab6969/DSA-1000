    /**
     * Algorithm:
     * 1. Sort the meetings array based on the start time. (O(N log N))
     * 2. Initialize a variable `prevEnd` to keep track of the last occupied day. (O(1))
     * 3. Iterate through each meeting: (O(N))
     *    a. Determine the actual start day of the meeting by taking the max of meeting start and `prevEnd + 1`.
     *    b. Calculate the length of the meeting as (end - start + 1).
     *    c. Deduct the valid meeting length from the available `days`.
     *    d. Update `prevEnd` to the maximum of its current value and the meetingâ€™s end day.
     * 4. Return the remaining `days` after processing all meetings. (O(1))
     * 
     * Pseudocode:
     * 
     * FUNCTION countDays(days, meetings):
     *     SORT meetings based on start time
     *     prevEnd = 0
     *     FOR each meeting in meetings:
     *         start = MAX(meeting[0], prevEnd + 1)
     *         length = meeting[1] - start + 1
     *         days -= MAX(length, 0)
     *         prevEnd = MAX(prevEnd, meeting[1])
     *     RETURN days
     * 
     * Time Complexity: O(N log N) due to sorting, followed by O(N) iteration, resulting in O(N log N) overall.
     * Space Complexity: O(1) as sorting is done in place and only a few extra variables are used.
